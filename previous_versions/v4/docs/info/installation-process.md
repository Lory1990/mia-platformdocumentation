#Installation Process

Mia s.r.l. is always aware about the installation status of the Mia-platform's suites.

Installation Process has to be managed by Mia s.r.l. or by a system-integrator partner.
Please find here below the installation process detailed:

* The client agrees with Mia which suite wants to install

* Mia prepares the configuration for the installation

* Mia provides an installation key

* The key is injected in the cluster configuration

* When the platform starts, the key is hashed and sent to activation service, hosted by Mia

* If the key is correct, the service provides the authorization and the platform starts

* If the key is corrupted or incorrect,the services don't start
