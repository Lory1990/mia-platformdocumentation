##Login

To access the API Console, simply connect from a normal browser to the following address [Link to Api Console](https://console.cloud.mia-platform.eu/login)

To login you must have access to the GitLab project you want to access. The Login in fact connects directly to the GitLab repository, in this way the accesses to the API Console reflect the permissions of GitLab

Once logged in you must choose the project and the branch on which you want to work.

!!! Warning
    If you are starting a **new project** the first thing to do is **create a secret** and check that there is one and **only one active**. To do this, see the chapter *"Secret"*.
