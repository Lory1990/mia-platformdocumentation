# Custom Microservice in Node.js

In addition to standard components (e.g., CRUD), the platform can include components that encapsulate ad-hoc logics that are autonomously developed and integrated: they are called **Custom Microservices**. A Custom Microservice (**CM**) is a service that receives HTTP requests, whose cycle of use and deploy is managed by the platform.  


A CM encapsulates ad-hoc business logics that can be developed by any user of the platform and potentially in any programming language. However, to facilitate its adoption and use, Mia-Platform team has created `custom-plugin-lib`, a library in [node.js](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib), based on the [fastify](https://fastify.io) library. Using `custom-plugin-lib` it is possible to create a CM by implementing the following steps:

* [HTTP Routes handler](#routes)
* [changing the behaviour according to the client that is making the request, whether the user is logged in and its belonging groups](#user-and-client-identification)
* [requests to other services or CM of the platform](#endpoint-queries-and-platform-services)
* [PRE and POST decorators](#pre-and-post-decorators)

In the remaining part of this guide it will be described how to develop, test and deploy a CM in Node.js withing the platform ecosystem using the `custom-plugin-lib` library.

## Installation and Bootstrap

### Install from Marketplace template

From the service area it is possible to add a new service starting from the node template that is already set up and configured to use the `custom-plugin-lib`.

Check out the [Marketplace Documentation](./../../../marketplace/overview-marketplace.md) for further information

### Manual install in a new repository

To start developing it is necessary to have installed `node.js` on your laptop and to initialize a node project with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir my-custom-plugin
cd my-custom-plugin
npm init -y
```

Open the `package.json` file and modify the `name`, `description` fields accordingly.
The `version` field at the beginning is best valued at` 0.0.1`.

`custom-plugin-lib` can be installed with` npm`, along with its `fastify-cli` dependency, necessary for booting
and the execution of the CM

```bash
npm i --save @mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib
```

The library can be used to instantiate an HTTP server.
To start a CM developed with `custom-plugin-lib` the variables need to be available to the `nodejs` process environment:

* USERID_HEADER_KEY = miauserid
* USER_PROPERTIES_HEADER_KEY = miauserproperties
* GROUPS_HEADER_KEY = miausergroups
* CLIENTTYPE_HEADER_KEY = miaclienttype
* BACKOFFICE_HEADER_KEY = isbackoffice
* MICROSERVICE_GATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME = Microservice-gateway

Among these variables, the most interesting is `MICROSERVICE_GATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME`, which contains the network name (or IP address) at which `microservice-gateway` is accessible and is used during [internal communication with other services](#queries-to-enpoint-and-platform-services) in your project namespace. The implication is that `MICROSERVICE_GATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME` makes it possible to configure your local CM
to query a specific microservice inside your Mia-Platform project. For example

```Bash
MICROSERVICE_GATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME = "microservice-gateway"
```

To instantiate the HTTP server you can paste the following piece of code in the service entrypoint (tipically the `index.js` file).

```js
const customPlugin = require('@mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib')()
module.exports = customPlugin(async service => {

  // alle richieste in GET sulla rotta /status/alive
  // rispondi con l'oggetto JSON { "status": "ok" }
  service.addRawCustomPlugin(
    'GET',
    '/status/alive',
    async (request, reply) => ({
      status: 'ok'
    })
  )
})
```


To start the CM, simply edit the `package.json` file in this way

```js
//...
"scripts": {
  // ...  
  "start": "fastify start src/index.js",
```

execute `npm start` and open a browser at the url [`http://localhost:3000/status/alive`](http://localhost:3000/status/alive), to get an answer.

## Factory exposed by `custom-plugin-lib`

`custom-plugin-lib` exports a function which creates the infrastructure ready to accept the definition
of routes and decorators. This code extract exemplifies its use.
```js
const customPlugin = require('@mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib')()

module.exports = customPlugin(function(service) { })
```
The argument of the `customPlugin` function is a ** declaration function ** whose argument is an object that allows
to define routes and decorators.

## Routes

`custom-plugin-lib` allows to define the behavior of the CM in response to an HTTP request, in a declarative style.
For this purpose, the `addRawCustomPlugin` function is used as shown in the first argument of the declaration function.

```js
service.addRawCustomPlugin(httpVerb, path, handler, schema)
```

whose arguments are, in order

* `httpVerb` - the HTTP verb of the request (e.g.,` GET`)
* `path` - the route path (e.g.,` /status /alive`)
* [`handler`](#handlers) - function that contains the actual behavior. It must respect the same interface defined in the
documentation of the handlers of [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Routes/#async-await).
* [`schema`](#scheme-and-documentation-of-a-route) - definition of the request and response data schema.
The format is the one accepted by [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Validation-and-Serialization)


#### Example

```js
const customPlugin = require('@mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib')()

// comportamento in risposta all'interrogazione
async function aliveHandler(request, reply) {
  return { status: 'ok' }
}

// schema della risposta
const aliveSchema = {
  response: {
    200: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        status: { type: 'string' },
      },
    },
  },
}

// wiring e dichiarazione delle rotte
module.exports = customPlugin(async function(service) {
  service.addRawCustomPlugin('GET', '/status/alive', aliveHandler, aliveSchema)
})
```

## Handlers

A `handler` is a function that respects the handler interface of [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Routes/) and
accepts a [Request](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Request/) and a [Reply](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reply/).
In addition to the fastify Request interface, `custom-plugin-lib` decorates the Request instance with information related to the Platform as
the `id` user currently logged in, its groups, the type of client that performed the HTTP request and if the request comes from the CMS.
Furthermore, the Request instance is also decorated with methods that allow HTTP requests to be made to other services released on the Platform.

### User and Client Identification

The instance of `Request` (the first argument of a handler) is decorated with functions

* `getUserId` - exposes the user's Ê»id`, if logged in or` null`
* `getUserProperties` - exposes the user's properties of the logged user or `null`
* `getGroups` - exposes an array containing strings that identify the groups to which the logged in user belongs
* `getClientType` - exposes the type of client that performed the HTTP request
* `isFromBackOffice` - exposes a boolean to discriminate whether the HTTP request from the CMS

#### Example

```js
async function helloHandler(request, reply) {
  // accesso all'id dell'utente (passato come
  // header all'interno della piattaforma)
  return `Hello ${request.getUserId()}`
}
```

### Context
Inside the handler scope it's possible to access fastify instance using `this`.

#### Example

```js
module.exports = customPlugin(async function(service) {
  // decorating custom enviroment variable
  service.decorate('decoratedService', service.config.DECORATED_SERVICE) 
  // creating custum route
  service.addRawCustomPlugin('GET', '/hello', helloHandler)
})

async function helloHandler(request, reply) {
    // `this` references the fastify context
    this.decoratedService // access custom fastify decoration
    this.config["LOG_LEVEL"] // access configured environment variable
})
```

## Endpoint queries and Platform services

Both from the `Request` (the first argument of a handler) or the `Service` (the first argument of the declaration function) it is possible to obtain a proxy object to invoke other endpoints or services running in the Platform project. For example, if you need to connect to a CRUD, you have to use a Proxy towards the `crud-service`. These proxies are already configured to automatically transmit Platform headers.

There are two types of proxies, returned by two distinct functions:

 * `getServiceProxy(options)` - proxy passing through `microservice-gateway`
 * `getDirectServiceProxy(serviceName, options)` - direct proxy to the service

The fundamental difference between the two proxies is that the first one activates all the logics that are registered in `microservice-gateway`,
while the second does not. For example, if a resource exposed by the CRUD service is protected by ACL, this protection will come
bypassed using the direct proxy.

For the direct proxy it is necessary to specify the `serviceName` of the service to be queried. The port cannot be specified in the `serviceName` but must be passed in the `port` field of the `options`. In the case of `getServiceProxy`, you should not specify the name of the service as it is implicitly that of the `microservice-gateway`.
The `options` parameter is an object with the following optional fields:

 * `port` - an integer that identifies the port of the service to be queried
 * `protocol` - a string that identifies the protocol to use (only `http` and `https` are supported, default value is `http`)
 * `headers` - an object that represents the set of headers to forward to the service
 * `prefix` - a string representing the prefix of the service call path

Potentially, the `getDirectServiceProxy` method allows you to also query services outside the platform. In this case, however, it is necessary to bear in mind that the platform headers will be automatically forwarded.

Both proxies, by default, forward the four mia-headers to the service called. To do this, the following environment variables must be present:

 * USERID_HEADER_KEY
 * GROUPS_HEADER_KEY
 * CLIENTTYPE_HEADER_KEY
 * BACKOFFICE_HEADER_KEY

The values of these variables will specify the key of the four mia-headers.

In addition, other headers of the original request can also be forwarded to the named service. To do this it is necessary to define an additional environment variable, `ADDITIONAL_HEADERS_TO_PROXY`, whose value must be a string containing the keys of the headers to be forwarded separated by a comma.

Both proxies expose the functions

 * `get(path, querystring, options)`
 * `post(path, body, querystring, options)`
 * `put(path, body, querystring, options)`
 * `patch(path, body, querystring, options)`
 * `delete(path, body, querystring, options)`

The topics to be passed to these functions are:

 * `path` - a string that identifies the route to which you want to send the request
 * `body` - optional, the body of the request which can be:
    * a JSON object
    * a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#)
    * one [Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)
 * `querystring` - optional, an object that represents the querystring
 * `options` - optional, an object that admits all the` options` listed above for the `getServiceProxy` and` getDirectServiceProxy` methods (which will eventually be overwritten), plus the following fields:
    * `returnAs` - a string that identifies the format in which you want to receive the response. It can be `JSON`,` BUFFER` or `STREAM`. Default `JSON`.
    * `allowedStatusCodes` - an array of integers that defines which status codes of the response are accepted. If the response status code is not contained in this array, the promise will be rejected. If this parameter is omitted, the promise is resolved in any case (even if the interrogated server answers 500).
    * `isMiaHeaderInjected` - Boolean value that identifies whether Mia's headers should be forwarded in the request. Default `true`.

#### Example

```js
// Example of a request towards `tokens-collection` endpoint passing through Microservice Gateway
async function tokenGeneration(request, response) {
  const crudProxy = request.getServiceProxy()
  const result = await crudProxy
    .post('/tokens-collection/', {
      id: request.body.quotationId,
      valid: true
    })
  // ...
}
```

```js
// Example of a request towards `tokens-collection` endpoint bypassing Microservice Gateway
async function tokenGeneration(request, response) {
  const crudProxy = request.getDirectServiceProxy('crud-service')
  const result = await crudProxy
    .post('/tokens-collection/', {
      id: request.body.quotationId,
      valid: true
    })
  // ...
}
```

## PRE and POST decorators

Through `custom-plugin-lib` it is possible to declare PRE and POST decorators. From a conceptual point of view, a decorator
of (1) PRE or (2) POST is a transformation applied from `microservice-gateway` to (1) a request addressed
to a service (**original request**) or (2) to the reply (**original reply**) that this service sends to
caller. From a practical point of view, decorators are implemented as HTTP requests in `POST` to a specified CM. In order to use the decorators it is imporant to configure them also in the console. More information are available [in the Decorators docs](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/development_suite/api-console/api-design/decorators/).

The declaration of a decorator using `custom-plugin-lib` occurs in a similar way to the declaration of a route

 * `service.addPreDecorator(path, handler)`
 * `service.addPostDecorator(path, handler)`

#### Example

```js
module.exports = customService(async function(service) {
  // Examples of a PRE and a POST decorator definition using `custom-plugin-lib`.
  service.addPreDecorator('/is-valid', handler)   // PRE
  service.addPostDecorator('/is-valid', handler)  // POST

})
```

### Effective received HTTP request
PRE and POST decorator receive a POST HTTP request from `microservice-gateway` with the following json body:

#### PRE decorator schema

```json
{
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/the-original-request-path",
    "headers": { "my": "headers" },
    "query": { "my": "query" },
    "body": { "the": "body" },
}
```

#### POST decorator schema

```json
{
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/the-original-request-path",
    "query": { "my": "query" },
    "body": { "the": "body" },
    "headers": { "my": "headers" },
  },
  "response": {
    "body": { "the": "response body" },
    "headers": { "my": "response headers" },
    "statusCode": 200,
  }
}
```

### Access and Handling of the Original Request With Pre decorator
The utility functions exposed by the `Request` instance (the first parameter of a handler) are used to access the original request

 * `getOriginalRequestBody()` - returns the body of the original request
 * `getOriginalRequestHeaders()` - returns the headers of the original request
 * `getOriginalRequestMethod()` - returns the original request method
 * `getOriginalRequestPath()` - returns the path of the original request
 * `getOriginalRequestQuery()` - returns the querystring of the original request

In addition to the methods described above, the `Request` instance exposes an interface to modify the original request, which will come
forwarded by `microservice-gateway` to the target service. This interface is accessible using the `Request` instance method
`changeOriginalRequest` which returns an object by the following methods:

 * `setBody(newBody)` - change the body of the original request
 * `setHeaders(newHeaders)` - modify the headers of the original request
 * `setQuery(newQuery)` - modify the querystring of the original request

To leave the original request unchanged, the `leaveOriginalRequestUnmodified` function is used instead.

In all cases the PRE decorator handler must return either the object returned by `changeOriginalRequest` or the object returned by` leaveOriginalRequestUnmodified`.

#### Example of PRE Decorators

```js
// this PRE decorator reads a header of the original request
// and converts it to a querystring parameter
async function attachTokenToQueryString(request, response) {
  const originalHeaders = request.getOriginalRequestHeaders()
  const token = originalHeaders['x-token']

  if(token) {
    return request
      .changeOriginalRequest()
      .setQuery({ token })
  }
  // in case the token was not specified in the headers
  // the original request is left unchanged
  return request.leaveOriginalRequestUnmodified()
}
```

### Access and Manipulation of the Original Response With POST Decorator

As with the original request, the `Request` instance (the first parameter of a handler) is decorated with useful functions for
also access the original service original response information (these are available only for POST decorators)

 * `getOriginalResponseBody()` - returns the body of the original response
 * `getOriginalResponseHeaders()` - returns the headers of the original response
 * `getOriginalResponseStatusCode()` - returns the status code of the original response

In addition to the functions described above, the `Request` instance exposes an interface to modify the original response, which will come
forwarded by `microservice-gateway` to the calling client. This interface is accessible using the function
`changeOriginalResponse` concatenating it with invocations to functions

 * `setBody (newBody)` - change the body of the original answer
 * `setHeaders (newHeaders)` - modify the headers of the original answer
 * `setQuery (newQuery)` - modify the querystring of the original answer
 * `setStatusCode (newStatusCode)` - change the status code of the original response

To leave the original answer unchanged, instead, the `leaveOriginalResponseUnmodified` function is used.

In all cases the decorator handler must return either the object returned by `changeOriginalResponse` or the object returned by` leaveOriginalResponseUnmodified`.

#### Example of POST Decorators

```js
// this POST decorator reads a token from the original reply body
// and converts it into a header.
async function attachTokenToHeaders(request, response) {
  const originalBody = request.getOriginalResponseBody()
  const token = originalBody.token

  if (token) {
    return request
      .changeOriginalResponse()
      .setHeaders({
        ...request.getOriginalResponseHeaders(),
        "x-token": token,
      })
  }
  // in case the token is not present in the body of the answer
  // the original answer remains unchanged
  return request.leaveOriginalResponseUnmodified()
}
```

### Decorator Chain Stop

Through `microservice-gateway` it is possible to define a sequencer of decorators, so that the output of a
single decorator is passed to the next decorator. In special cases, however, it may be necessary
interrupt the chain and return a response to the original caller.

For this purpose, the `Request` instance (the first argument of a handler) exposes the function

```Js
abortChain (finalStatusCode, finalBody, finalHeaders)
```

#### Example

```js
// this PRE decorator verifies that a token is present
// in the header of the original request. If it is not present
// break the chain by returning an error 401 to the client
async function validateToken(request, response) {
  const headers = request.getOriginalResponseHeaders()
  const token = headers['x-token']
  if(!token) {
    return request.abortChain(401)
  }
  return request.leaveOriginalRequestUnmodified()
}
```

## Route Diagram and Documentation

A CM developed with `custom-plugin-lib` automatically also exposes the documentation of the routes and decorators that
are implemented. The documentation is specified using the [OpenAPI 2.0 standard](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/)
and exhibited through [Swagger](https://swagger.io). Once the CM is started, its documentation can be accessed at
route [`http: // localhost: 3000 / documentation`] (http: // localhost: 3000 / documentation). The specification of the request scheme
and responses to a route must conform to the format accepted by
[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Validation-and-Serialization).

### Example

```js
const schema = {
  body: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      someKey: { type: 'string' },
      someOtherKey: { type: 'number' }
    }
  },

  querystring: {
    name: { type: 'string' },
    excitement: { type: 'integer' }
  },

  params: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      par1: { type: 'string' },
      par2: { type: 'number' }
    }
  },

  headers: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      'x-foo': { type: 'string' }
    },
    required: ['x-foo']
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

Like any service on the Platform, a CM must be set up to be released in different environments, starting from the local environment (the development machine) to development, test and production environments. The differences between various environments are managed through the mechanism of environment variables.  
In addition to the mandatory ones, using `custom-plugin-lib` it is possible to define other environment variables based on
needs of the single CM, to then access them and use their values ââin the code of the handlers. For the definition yes
use the [JSON schema] format (http://json-schema.org/).

If the correct set of environment variables is not supplied to the CM,
the CM does not start by returning in output which environment variable is missing.


### Example
```js
// la variabile d'ambiente VARIABLE deve essere disponibile al processo
const serverSchema = {    
  type: 'object',
  required: ['VARIABLE'],  
  properties: {  
    VARIABLE: {  
      type: 'string',  
    },  
  },  
}  
const customPlugin = require('@mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib')(serverSchema)

module.exports = customPlugin(async service => {
  // nel config di service si
  // possono trovare le variabili
  // d'ambiente dichiarate
  const VARIABILE = service.config.VARIABILE

  service.addRawCustomPlugin(
    'GET',
    '/variable',
    async function (request, reply) {
      return {
        // Ã¨ possibile accedere alla configurazione tramite `this.config`
        secret: this.config.VARIABLE,
      }
    }
  )
})
```

## Testing

`custom-plugin-lib` is built on fastify and therefore integrates with [testing tools](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Testing/)
made available by the framework. A complete example of this type of test is present online in the repository of
`custom-plugin-lib` on [Github](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib/blob/master/examples/advanced/test/).

### Integration and Unit test

The testing of a CM built with `custom-plugin-lib` can be performed at multiple levels of abstraction. One of
Possibility is to use a technique called _fake http injection_ for which it is possible to simulate
receiving an HTTP request. In this way, all the CM logic is exercised from the HTTP layer to the handlers and
this is an example of Integration Testing.

#### Example Integration Test

In the example below the test framework [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

```js
'use strict'

const assert = require('assert')
const fastify = require('fastify')

const customPlugin = require('@mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib')()
const index = customPlugin(async service => {
  service.addRawCustomPlugin(
    'GET',
    '/status/alive',
    async (request, reply) => ({
      status: 'ok'
    })
  )
})

const createTestServer = () => {
  // silent => trace for enabliing logs
  const createdServer = fastify({ logger: { level: 'silent' } })
  createdServer.register(index)
  return createdServer
}

describe('/status/alive', () => {
  it('should be available', async () => {
    const server = createTestServer()

    const response = await server.inject({
      url: '/status/alive',
    })

    assert.equal(response.statusCode, 200)
  })
})
```
