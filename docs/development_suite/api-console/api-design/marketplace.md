# Marketplace

The Marketplace contains several code resources to develop your microservices with Mia-Platform. 

You can set-up easily microservice with predefined and tested functionality starting from a set of [examples](../../../marketplace/examples/overview-examples.md) and [template](../../../marketplace/templates/overview-templates.md) of the Marketplace.
You can do this clicking *Create a Microservice* and selecting an item.

Check out the relative [Marketplace section](../../../marketplace/overview-marketplace.md) for further information.
