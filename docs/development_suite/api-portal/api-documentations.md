##API Portal

Documentation is a vital part of any Restful API in order to drive consistency and discipline across your API development workflow. 

In the **Documentation Production** section, you can find automatically generated and kept in sync documentation, that semantically describes the API in a readable structure text format. 
The documentation let you know exactly how your API will work and behave, before integrating it into your code. It lists all the available REST-ends points and provides all detailed information: description, parameters, and schema.  

You can share API documentation within your company and externally to partners and suppliers. 

In order to test the APIs, you can access your tags on the right side of the screen, where the APIs are grouped according to their tags: by clicking on one tag, you will visualize all the APIs that belong to that tag - in our case, we will select the Tag “Ingredient”.

If you click a row with the API end-point, it will open up and you have the ability to execute the API request by pushing **Try it** - if the APIs are protected, you need to authenticate yourself.  
Once the single API is selected, in this area you can see the structure of the API and the data that are exposed. 

In the black box on the right, you can see the request, that can be seen as a cURL,in Node, in Javascript, and in Java.
