This page will give you a brief overview of **Mia-Platform Console**, explain **why it's important**, highlight the **advantages of adopting this internal platform solution** and provide a **brief description of its architecture**. 

## Product overview 

In an evolving, omnichannel market, successful enterprises must operate and innovate like tech companies by:

* Building and launching digital products **quickly**.
* Viewing market changes as **opportunities**.
* Being **flexible** to rapidly respond to demand fluctuations.
* **Integrating** with various tools, partners, and ecosystems.

Modern companies achieve this through an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). The tool to accomplish this is **Mia-Platform Console**, an Internal Developer Platform builder which aids in industrializing, managing and simplifying cloud-native development and operations.

## Why Mia-Platform Console is important

Mia-Platform Console manages the entire software lifecycle seamlessly and unify your IT department under one integrated platform. Simplify cloud-native development while maintaining complete governance and control over your processes.

* **Clear Governance**: Establish streamlined, standardized pathways for software delivery and integrate governance rules directly into your development workflows, ensuring consistency, compliance, and efficiency throughout the entire development process.
* **Self-service Approach**: Build and manage an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that empowers development teams by providing them with the necessary tools and resources in a self-service mode, enabling them to develop efficiently and autonomously without dependency on other departments.
* **Lower cognitive load**: Abstracting underlying complexities simplifies tasks for developers, minimizing cognitive load and reducing the need for frequent context switching. This enables them to concentrate more on creative problem-solving and efficient coding, ultimately enhancing productivity and innovation within development projects.

## Ease the digital platform development

Mia-Platform Console serves the IT team involved in software development because it brings several advantages to the development of an Internal Developer Platform.

- **Governance & controls**: Manage runtime resources across hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, connect clusters, establish self-service environments, enforce RBAC policies, and establish project templates that standardize developer tools, by creating 'paved roads'.
Using a Software Catalog, each team owns one or a group of projects.

* **Productivity & quality**: Software can be built in a unified environment that offers secure, self-service capabilities. By leveraging the GitOps methodology, applications can be exposed and deployed seamlessly from a centralized setup.
Enhance your development speed with ready-to-use services or by directly uploading Docker images.

* **Resilience & Observability**: Ensure long-term system integrity through advanced observability tools, metrics, and alerting mechanisms.
Enhance services usability with a functional document portal and with API testing capabilities.

The use of Mia-Platform Console does not bind in any way to a specific technology stack. This product integrates various technologies, ranging from front-end development to deployment tools.

Leverage the **[Marketplace](/marketplace/overview_marketplace.md)** to accelerate development. Thanks to this self-service catalog you can find a set of curated, standardized, and reusable software components to easily integrate in your Internal Developer Portal (IDP).
