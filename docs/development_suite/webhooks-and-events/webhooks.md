Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, which subscribe to certain events on the Console. When one of those events is triggered, the Console will send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL.

Webhooks can be installed on a Console instance, a specific company, or a specific project. Once installed, the webhook will be sent each time one or more subscribed events occurs.

## Events subscription

You can subscribe to events on the Console using the CMS. From the `Events` category, click the `Webhooks` page and the `Add new` to create a new webhook subscription. You will be asked to provide the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `tenantId` | `string` | If specified, only events triggerd inside the specified company will be delivered to the target URL. Must be a company identifier. |
| `projectId` | `string` | If specified, only events triggerd inside the specified project will be delivered to the target URL. Must be a project identifier. |
| `eventName` **required** | `string` | The name of the event to listen to. See the [event types page](./events). |
| `target` **required** | `string` | The URL of the HTTP endpoint that will manage the event trigger. |
| `base64CA` | `string` | The Certificate Authority exposed by the target URL ancoded in base64. |
| `secret` **required** | `string` | The shared secret used to authenticate the events payload. |
| `proxy.url` | `string` | The URL of the proxy. |

## Payload authentication

The payload delivered by the Console will be authenticated using the `X-Mia-Token` header. This will both prevent the modification of the payload by third-parties and allow the receiver to make sure that the event has been triggered by the Console.

**Note**: this authentication method is not safe agaist replay attacks. It is recommended to store the latest `eventTimestamp` on the receiver side to prevent this attack.

The `X-Mia-Token` header will contain the hex encoded `sha256` digest of the event payload concatenated with the provided `secret`. In formula:

```
X-Mia-Token = hex(sha256( payload + secret ))
```
