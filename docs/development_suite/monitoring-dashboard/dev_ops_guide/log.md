title:  Guidelines for logs
sidebar_label: Guidelines for logs
---
The objective of these guidelines is to guarantee uniformity in the logs generated by the platform and, thus, to ensure easy usage.

Logs are generated according to [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html) specifications.

## Guidelines

The following are guidelines, drawn from [guidelines and best practices suggested by Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/1.4/ecs-guidelines.html), which have to be followed when application logs are generated:

* Field names have to be in **camelCase**
* Field names don't have to contain special characters
* Field names have to properly be used in the singular or plural form according to the content of the field itself
* For custom fields use, where it makes sense, nesting in objects
* Avoid using abbreviations in field names as much as possible

:::note
Generally, the management of these logs has been entrusted to internal libraries:

* for the services **Node.js** , they will be managed by [lc39](https://github.com/mia-platform/lc39) and [custom-plugin](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib);
* for the services **Go** , they will be managed by [glogger](https://github.com/mia-platform/glogger);
* for the services **Kotlin**  and **Java**, instead, there are no internal libraries nowadays: custom implementations must be made.
:::

## Message

The text message passed to the log is, by default, inserted in the key ```msg```, if only one object has been passed to the logger. Make sure that the key used for the message is the same.

## Mandatory Fields

In each log, the following fields have to be always present:

| name        | type   | description                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ```reqId``` | string | taken from the platform headers and necessary to trace the flow of each request; |
| ```time```  | number | that signals the moment when it was generated in Unix timestamp                  |
| ```level``` | number | this marks the importance level of a log                                         |

### Use the appropriate logging level

It is important to always use the correct level; Each level has a value expressed in tenths.
To choose which is the appropriate level, one should rely on the following criteria:

| name          | level | description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ```trace```   | 10    | to trace the operations flow of the application (do not use in production)                                                                        |
| ```debug```   | 20    | to report information that may be useful in troubleshooting (do not use in production)                                                            |
| ```info```    | 30    | in cases where the service has to give information about the branch of code in execution, generally this type of log should be strictly necessary |
| ```warning``` | 40    | in cases of recoverable error, the service can continue to process the request                                                                    |
| ```error```   | 50    | in cases of not recoverable error and error for which the processing of the request (but not the service) must be interrupted                     |
| ```fatal```   | 60    | in cases of unexpected and not recoverable error, and as a result of which the service must stop its execution                                    |

:::note
It is important to enter in logs the right information that is used to track operations, highlight problems and allow troubleshooting.
It is equally important to pay close attention to what is entered in logs, avoiding, in any case, to insert in the messages or in the custom properties of logs, any private value that can lead to privacy issues.
:::

## Mandatory Logs

Each service must necessarily generate the logs of the table below specifying the following fields in addition to the mandatory field specify above.

| **Event**         | **Level**   | **Field**                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Incoming request  | ```trace``` | ```host```, ```url```                                  |
| Request completed | ```info```  | ```host```, ```http```, ```responseTime```,  ```url``` |

:::note
If the service is not REST but takes its inputs from another source, the same criterion has been applied;
Use a log ```trace``` when the processing event starts, and a log ```info``` when the event ends;
The final log has to contain as much useful information as possible.
:::

## Field ECS Definition

The following are examples taken ECS documentation. None of the fields is mandatory, however it is important to use standard keys, if applicable.

### Errors

If you want to create error logs we recommend this structure
When an error log has been generated, the passed object must necessarily have the key ```error```,
whose value has to be an object of the form specified by ECS for the [Error Fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/1.4/ecs-error.html),
which are shown in the table below:
