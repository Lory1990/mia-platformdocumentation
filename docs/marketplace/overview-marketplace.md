# Why always start from scratch? Check out the Mia Marketplace

The Mia Marketplace contains several code resources to develop your microservices with Mia-Platform.

You can access to Marketplace from the *Design area* of *DevOps Console*, when you are [creating a new microservice](/../development_suite/api-console/api-design/plugin_baas_4/).

You will see a set of [examples](./examples/overview-examples.md) and [template](./templates/overview-templates.md), powered and supported by Mia-Platform, that you can select to set-up easily microservice with predefined and tested functionality.

You can go deeper into the code of templates and examples visiting the [Marketplace Github repository](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace).
