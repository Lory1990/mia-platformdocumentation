# Examples

An **Example** provides a specific use-case, it's a ready-to-use model to create your microservice.  

Currently available examples are:

| **Example** | **Technologies** | **Use case** |
| ------|------------|------------|
|[Node.js HelloWorld Microservice Example](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/Node.js-Hello-World-Microservice-Example)|Node.js, JavaScript| An example that exposes a route and replies with a HelloWorld JSON: it allows you to see how Node.js microservice and tests are done.|
|[Node.js Call CRUD Example](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/Node.js-Call-CRUD-Example)| Node.js, JavaScript| Example of a Node.js microservice which enables to use Mia Platform Custom Plugin to access the CRUD. |
|[Node.js Custom Plugin with Mongo Example](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/Node.js-Custom-Plugin-Mongo-Example)| Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB|  Example of using Mia Platform Custom Plugin and queries to access MongoDB. |
|[Node.js Pre/Post Example](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/Node.js-PrePost-Microservice-Example)| Node.js, JavaScript| Example of a Node.js microservice which enables to use Mia Platform Custom Plugin to access the CRUD. |
|[GraphQL Custom Plugin Example](ttps://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/GraphQL-Custom-Plugin-Example)|Node.js, JavaScript, GraphQL |  Example of integrating GraphQL in a Node.js microservice. |
|[Kafka2Rest Example](ttps://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/GraphQL-Custom-Plugin-Example)|Node.js, JavaScript, GraphQL | An example of how taking messages from Kafka broker and sends POST request after filtering and processing them, using Kafka2Rest library. |

  * **Kafka2Rest Example**: It takes messages from Kafka broker and sends POST request after filtering and processing the messages. This is an Example that helps you to use Kafka2Rest library.

  * **Rest2Kafka Example**: It takes the body of a POST and create a Kafka starting from REST messages. This is an Example that helps you to use Rest2Kafka library.

  * **C++ Oat ++ Hello World Example**: Example that shows how to use the Oat ++ library to set-up a backend. [Here](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/cpp-oatpp-hello-world-microservice-example/blob/master/README.md) you can learn more about C++ Oat ++ Hello World Example. 

  * **.NET Core 3.1 Hello World Example**: This is a simple .NET microservice. [Here](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/DotNet-Hello-World-Microservice-Example/blob/master/README.md) you can learn more about .NET Core 3.1 Hello World Example. 

More examples are in development, but if you want, you can build an example from your own yourself.
