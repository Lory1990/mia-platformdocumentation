## Why always start from scratch

The Mia-Platform Marketplace contains several code resources to develop your microservices with Mia-Platform.

You can access the Mia-Platform Marketplace from the *Design area* of *DevOps Console*, when you are [creating a new microservice](./../development_suite/api-console/api-design/services.md#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-an-example-or-from-a-template).

You will see a set of [examples](./examples/mia_examples.md) and [templates](./templates/mia_templates.md), powered and supported by Mia-Platform, you can choose from to easily set-up a microservice with predefined and tested functionality.

You can go deeper into the code of templates and examples visiting the [Mia-Platform Marketplace Github page](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace).

You can start from a:

* **Plugin**: a ready-to-use Microservice.  
Check out the [Microservice section](./../../docs/runtime_suite/overview-runtime-suite.md) for further information.

* **Template**: a base repository from which you can start to create a new Microservice.  
Check out the [Template section](./templates/mia_templates.md) for further information.

* **Example**: a specific use-case, a ready-to-use model to create your microservice.  
Check out the [Example section](./examples/mia_examples.md) for further information.

* **Docker Image Name**: an existing Docker image of a Microservice.  
Check out the [Create services section](./../development_suite/api-console/api-design/services.md#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-a-docker-image) for further information.

You can search for Microservices, filtering by Plugins, Templates and/or Examples.
