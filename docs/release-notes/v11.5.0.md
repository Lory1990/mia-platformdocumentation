## Console

### New Features

#### Project Settings 

Inside the 'Overview' area of a Project, you can now access a brand new section called 'Settings', where users with enough administrative permissions can view and manage the settings of their Project. This will speed-up and optimize the administration of their Project, which – until now – was only possible via CMS, making it no longer tedious or error-prone!

For more information about Project settings, [go to the official documentation] [TO BE INSERTED]

### Improvements

#### User Profile section 

We have enhanced the viewing and management of user profile settings and preferences, combining them into a single section always accessible from the Console launchbar. As a matter of fact, by clicking on the new `Profile` option from the dropdown menu, you will be presented with a section containing two tabs: `Personal info` and "Preferences`.  
In the `Personal info` tab, you will find a brief summary of your profile and an external link for managing your profile settings on the identity provider.  
Within the "Preferences" tab, you can view and manage user's specific preferences.
