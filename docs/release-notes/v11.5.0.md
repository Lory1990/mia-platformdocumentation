## Console

### New Features

#### Project Settings 

Inside the 'Overview' area of a Project, you can now access a brand new section called 'Settings', where users with enough administrative permissions can view and manage the settings of their Project. This will speed-up and optimize the overall administration of Projects, which – until now – was only possible exclusively via CMS, making it no longer tedious or error-prone!

For more information about Project Settings, [go to the official documentation](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/project-settings.md).

### Improvements

#### User Profile section 

We have enhanced the viewing and management of user profile settings and preferences, combining them into a single section always accessible from the Console launchbar. As a matter of fact, by clicking on the new `Profile` option from the dropdown menu, you will be presented with a section containing two tabs: `Personal info` and `Preferences`.  
In the `Personal info` tab, you will find a brief summary of your profile and an external link for managing your profile settings on the identity provider.  
Within the "Preferences" tab, you can view and manage user's specific preferences.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* When configuring a _Single View Creator Service_ inside the `Single Views` section, creating a new _Validator_ will generate a file with an empty function to avoid to automatically save an empty file that might cause a crash of the Single View Creator Service configured.

## Fast Data

### Mongo Collections and Views support multiple tags

The collections configured in the section `MongoDB CRUD` and the views configured in the `MongoDB Views` section can have more than one tag. These tags will be then included in the configuration files passed to the `CRUD Service` to have the collections grouped by said tags, in order to simplify the use of the service.

Please mind that it is possible to create multiple tags only if the `CRUD Service` configured in the project have version `6.8.0` or superior. In case there are different version per environment, all the versions defined must be equal or superior to `6.8.0` to configure these tags.

### Support of Lookup in CRUD Views

In the `MongoDB Views` section, it is possible to enable _lookup_, following specific pipeline requirements to obtain data from _lookup_ collections, simplifying interaction with views and improving support for collections with _one-to-one_ or _many-to-one_ relationships.

More information can be found in the [official documentation](/runtime_suite/crud-service/50_writable_views.md).

Please mind that it is possible to enable lookups only if the `CRUD Service` configured in the project have version `6.9.0` or superior. In case there are different version per environment, all the versions defined must be equal or superior to `6.8.0` to enable lookups.
