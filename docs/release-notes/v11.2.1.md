## Console

### New Features

#### Console CLI v0.6.1

The new `miactl` version provides support for service account authentication.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed a bug in the login and session management that caused login button not to display on certain conditions and users to be logged out without notice.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.2.1`.
