## Console

### New Features

#### Manage and configure Webhooks directly via Console UI

Starting from today, it will be possible to view, create, edit and delete custom Console Webhooks directly through the user interface.
Whereas before today this was only possible through Console CMS, now the user can enter the "Company Overview" area and under the "Webhooks" section can easily and intuitively manage all the respective hooks.

## Fast Data

### New Features

#### Fast Data No Code Configuration for Aggregation

![No Code Aggregation](./img/overview/fast_data_no_code_aggregation_example.png)

It is with great pleasure to inform you that it is now possible to generate an Aggregation configuration without writing a line of code!

The new feature will allow you to see a list of Single View fields, taken from the Single View Data Model, and to easily map them to their related Base Projection fields with point-and-click actions. You will only need to select a dependency, an automatically generated path to reach this dependency, and, eventually, a field in order to set the mapping.

This tool will then create a JSON file containing the newly set Aggregation config map, which will be then used by the Single View Creator service. The generated JSON is exactly the same JSON that would have been written manually in the Low Code Configuration. If you still wish to configure your JSON manually, an Advanced Mode toggle will allow you to switch between the No Code and the manual mode.

To access the new feature, please navigate to the Single Views section, open a Single View, then its related Single View Creator and click on the updated Aggregation tab, where you will be able to create a new configuration or edit the existing one.

This feature is available only for SaaS users and it can be activated only for specific projects. If you want to try it out, contact your system administrator!
Do not miss out the [official documentation](/fast-data/configuration/config_maps/aggregation.md#use-the-no-code).

#### Fast Data No Code Configuration for Single View Key and other settings

Each Single View Creator detail page now includes a Settings tab, which replaces the existing Single View Key tab.

The new tab includes the following sections:

- Single View Key, where it is possible to configure and edit a Single View Key configuration in a No Code mode. The new feature will allow you to easily map a Single View field to a Base Projection field (or to a Projection Changes identifier) and to automatically generate a configuration JSON file. As it is for the No Code ER Schema and for the newly introduced Aggregation, it will still be possible to manually configure the Single View Key by using the Advanced mode
- General Settings, where it is possible to access and edit data about the selected ER Schema and Base Projection
- Generate Aggregation, where it is possible to generate an Aggregation JSON configuration by automatically matching the fields of the Single View with those of the projections, based on the information in the selected ER Schema

### Backoffice Library - 1.3.15

#### New Features

##### `bk-expanded-filters` parse URL
`bk-expanded-filters` optionally performs bootstrap, applying filters that are read from URL

##### New component `bk-file-picker-modal`

New component [bk-file-picker-modal](/business_suite/backoffice/components/data_manipulation#bk-file-picker-modal) is available, analogous to `bk-file-picker-drawer`.

##### File metadata can be added

File fields support `dataSchema` and `items` properties, allowing to specify meta-data. Form components interact with `bk-file-picker-drawer` and `bk-file-picker-modal` to edit files with metadata.

#### Bug Fix

Nested objects/arrays are correctly updated when editing form is spawned through `customActions` property of `bk-table`

##### `bk-button` is temporarily disabled on file download/upload
`disbaleOnAction` property of `bk-button` correctly interacts with `bk-file-client`

## Marketplace
