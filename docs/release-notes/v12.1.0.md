## Console

### New Features

#### New User events for the Webhook section

User events have been added that allow a Company Owner to configure and trigger specific webhooks when changes to user access management occur.

Listed below are the events that have been added with this release:

* User added to Company
* User Company role edited.
* User removed from Company
* User added to Project
* User removed from Project

For more information regarding individual events, please [go to the documentation]().

#### Complete Company access management through `miactl`

The new version of `miactl` allows complete management of all identities access to the Company.
More specifically, starting from today it will be possible to add, modify and remove any type of identity (User, Service Account, Group) simply through command line.

For more information on the specific commands introduced, please [go to the documentation]().

### Improvements

#### Improved User session management in Console

The User session management in Console has been enhanced, improving the error message displayed when the User session expires.

#### Enhanced default branch management for Template and Example creation

The default branch handling during pipeline setup from Marketplace Templates and Examples creation has been improved. Now, when creating those resources, if the branch is not specified within the pipeline definition, the provider will dynamically retrieve the repository's default branch in which the pipeline is located, instead of statically selecting the master branch.
