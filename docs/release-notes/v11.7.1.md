## Console

### Hotfix: Fast Data deletes public variables

This version ships the hotfix for Public Variables for Fast Data deletion bug, if Fast Data is enabled, that was introduced with `v11.7.0`.

When saving in Design with `v11.7.0` Public Variables for Fast Data services that start with the `FAST_DATA` prefix are deleted and regenerated. This could lead to different Fast Data public variables leading to impossible deployment for Fast Data services. 

#### How to resolve the issue if I've already saved

TODO

### Hotfix: Fast Data generates Projection Changes collection with interpolated variable names

This version ships the hotfix for a wrong generation of Fast Data Projection Changes Collection when the collection name has an interpolated variable that was introduced with `v11.7.0`.

When saving in Design with `v11.7.0` there could be the possibility that some Projection Changes Collection with a `{{PC_COLLECTION_NAME}}` name are created, which prevents from saving. 

#### How to resolve the issue if I've already saved

You can manually delete the collections that have the `{{PC_COLLECTION_NAME}}` name or revert the incriminated commit.

## How to update your Console
