## Console

### Bug Fix

This version addressed a bug that wrongly generates the CRUD service configuration. The CRUD service additional properties are now correctly defined.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.X.X`.
