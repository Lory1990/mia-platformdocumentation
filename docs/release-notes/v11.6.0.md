## Console

### New Features

#### Project Settings

Inside the 'Overview' Area of a Project, you can now access a brand new section called 'Settings', where users with enough administrative permissions can view and manage the settings of their Project. This will speed-up and optimize the overall administration of Projects, which – until now – was only possible exclusively via CMS, making it no longer tedious or error-prone!

For more information about Project Settings, [go to the official documentation](/console/project-configuration/project-settings.md).

#### Delete a Project

To enable even more exhaustive management of the resources in Console, it is now possible to delete a project directly from its settings. 
Simply go to the respective Advanced tab and the user can easily delete a project with all its resources. 

For more information, [go to the official documentation](/console/project-configuration/delete-a-project.md).

#### Share Internal Company Marketplace items to other Companies with Marketplace Providers

We are thrilled to announce that from now on a Company will be able to allow access to the resources of its Internal Company Marketplace to other Companies!  
This can be done thanks to the introduction of a new Marketplace feature for Providers in Console. 

You will be able to add a Marketplace Provider in your Company and manage the accessibility of Marketplace resources connected to that Provider directly from the Providers section in Console. All you need to do is to add a Marketplace Provider by clicking on the "Add Marketplace Provider connection" option – available in the Providers section – and then configure on the CMS all the Marketplace resources that you want to make available to other Companies. This can be done by specifying the providerId of the Marketplace Provider and editing the visibility property for each of those Marketplace resources.

For more information about how to connect a Marketplace resource to a Marketplace Provider and make it available to other Companies, visit the related [documentation page](/marketplace/add_to_marketplace/marketplace_items_accessibility.md). You can find other precious information also inside the Providers documentation section, available [here](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx#connect-a-provider-for-marketplace).

#### Manually launch CronJobs from the Runtime Area

From now on, users with enough administrative permissions can manually launch immediate executions of CronJobs directly from the Runtime area of the Console. This action can be triggered either from the options menu in the CronJobs Table, or by clicking the button in the CronJob Describe page. Once launched, you will see the created Job and the relative Pod in the dedicated resource sections of the Runtime area.

#### Delete Jobs from Jobs section

In the Jobs section of the Runtime Area, users with enough administrative permissions can now delete Jobs from the Jobs table.

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Configurator

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* documentation links have been fixed to align with the changes inside the Fast Data section of the docs
* it is now possible to correctly see nested fields (e.g. Array of Objects) inside the No Code Aggregation, without seeing them disappear after clicking

##### Improvements
