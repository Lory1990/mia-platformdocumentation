## Console

### New Features

#### Project Settings

Inside the 'Overview' Area of a Project, you can now access a brand new section called 'Settings', where users with enough administrative permissions can view and manage the settings of their Project. This will speed-up and optimize the overall administration of Projects, which – until now – was only possible exclusively via CMS, making it no longer tedious or error-prone!

For more information about Project Settings, [go to the official documentation](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/project-settings.md).

#### Delete a Project

To enable even more exhaustive management of the resources in Console, it is now possible to delete a project directly from its settings. 
Simply go to the respective Advanced tab and the user can easily delete a project with all its resources. 

For more information, [go to the official documentation](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/delete-a-project.md).
