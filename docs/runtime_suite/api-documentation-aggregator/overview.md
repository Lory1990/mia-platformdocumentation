This application groups the plugins API Portal and Swagger Aggregator - including the endpoints needed to make them work - in order to aggregate the individual [Open APIs](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) of all the microservices indicated in the configuration and show them through a graphical interface.

To reach the portal and visualize all the routes exposed by the endpoints, go to the "Settings" section of the project, and then click the "Go to Documentation" button within the table line related to the reference environment.

For further information about the specific plugins refer to their documentation:
- [API Portal](../../runtime_suite/api-portal/overview)
- [Swagger Aggregator](../../runtime_suite/swagger-aggregator/overview)
