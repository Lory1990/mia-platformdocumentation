### PDF Service ###

This plugin provided an easy way to generate PDF files from an initial HTML template. This service is based on the [Puppeteer library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
If you use this service on your computer, it is very important to set the DOCKER environment variable to false.
