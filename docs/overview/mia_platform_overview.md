## What is Mia-Platform?

Mia-Platform is a platform builder: it provides all the capabilities to build and manage modern digital platforms and the tools to empower your Platform Strategy. Mia-Platform is built by developers for developers: its main purpose is streamlining the development cycle of microservices on Kubernetes environments. All the tools you need are gathered together: from the infrastructure, to the microservice orchestration, to managing the software lifecycle. Just choose the tool that fits you best, and let Mia-Platform take care of the rest.

With Mia-Platform you can take advantage of:
- Choosing what **Infrastructure** will host your platform and services, from the main Cloud providers to On-premises solutions;
- Leveraging the best **Microservice orchestrator** on the market, Kubernetes;
- The ever-increasing set of **Products** for a complete **Software lifecycle** management.

Mia-Platform takes care of simplifying the cloud complexity, so that you can focus on building your business products instead of wasting time setting up the platform.

## What Mia-Platform provides you with

Mia-Platform provides you with two main tools to govern complexity and speed up your development teams:

- **Mia-Platform Console**: a powerful [Internal Developer Portal](/dev_portal/overview.md) to govern all projects in one place and to industrialize DevOps;
- **The Marketplace**: a catalog of ready-to-use components to speed up development and to promote reuse of code and evolvability in the long term.

Find out more about [Mia-Platform Console](/development_suite/overview-dev-suite.md) and the [Marketplace](/marketplace/overview_marketplace.md).

You can adopt Mia-Platform either in a [Self-Hosted](/self_hosted/self_hosted_requirements.md) infrastructure or as [PaaS](/paas/overview.md). In the first case Mia-Platform will be integrated in your existing infrastructure while in the second case you will be freed from installing in-house hardware and software and leverage the advantages of the Cloud. In both cases, Mia-Platform Console will allow you to govern all projects in one place, industrialize & automate DevOps, avoid organizational bottlenecks, self-serve developers, solve cloud complexity and enhance accountability & reliability.
