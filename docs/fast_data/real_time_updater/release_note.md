Here below you can read the release note of the Real-Time Updater service. Only the versions upper than 3.0.0 are available because the lowers versions are not compatible with the Console. 

## 3.1.0 (2021-06-24)

Support to **Object** and **Array Of Object** fields for [Projections](../create_projection) has been added. You can now choose these types of fields in the [Projections Field](../create_projection#projection-fields) section of your Projection and set them to your own cast function or use the default one.
