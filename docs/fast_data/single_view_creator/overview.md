## Microservice initialization

Each Single View needs a dedicated Microservice. This service will listen on the **Projections changes** that affect the Single View and consequently updates its data. This service is the `Single View Creator`.

To start configuring your own Single View Creator, you have three options:

* Start from the *Single View Creator - Low Code Plugin*
* Start from the *Single View Creator Plugin*
* Start from the *Single View Creator Template*

The first option uses the Low Code configuration, the second and third options use the manual configuration. More information about the differences between Low Code and manual configurations can be found [here](../no_code_overview.md).
