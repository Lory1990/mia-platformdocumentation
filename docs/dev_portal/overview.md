Dev portal is the interface between a set of APIs, SDKs, or other interactive digital tools, and their various stakeholders: it can be used to understand, interact, adopt, monitor, and govern new technologies.  

The portal can play several roles to achieve the business goals of an organization.

The keys of a dev portal are:
- [API Documentation](#api-documentation)
- [Support](#support)
- [Development Speed](#development-speed)

### API documentation

Documentation is a fundamental part of a developer portal: you can judge its quality by the quality of the documentation,
because developers examine documentation and decide if they can understand the service.

### Support

Developer portals also provide support and specification for the products:
you can deeply describe in this section aspects that are too complex for the API documentation, 
to allow developers to solve their problems independently. 

### Development Speed

Have all the documentation in one place allows you to find everything quickly, thanks also to sample code, snippets and detailed instructions.

## The Mia way

Mia built the dev portal using [`microlc`](https://github.com/mia-platform/microlc): its open source product to easily deploy web application using the micro-frontends technology.

Dev portal encloses in a single-page application, the following tools:

- _[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)_: used to create documentation section;
- _[RapiDoc](https://mrin9.github.io/RapiDoc/)_: used to display the OpenAPI/Swagger-generated API reference documentation.

For more details about the configurations of the `Dev Portal`, or to understand how to configure these tools individually, refer to the following pages.
