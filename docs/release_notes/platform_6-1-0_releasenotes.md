### New Features

### Node microservices update with a new log format

The node microservices have been updated to the new [lc-39](https://github.com/mia-platform/lc39) version based on the new Mia-Platform guidelines released in v6.1.0.

### Bug fix

### HelloWorld example DotNet

The service is now working correctly. Additionally, the following bugs have been fixed:

### Extended support for mongo operators in CRUD

CRUD Service now supports `$inc`, `$set` and `$unset` for custom properties of fields with type `Object`.

Each project now allows to specify a custom scheme for the configured hosts (default scheme is `https`).

### Added warning for missing CPU and Memory limits

When trying to save the project configuration a new warning shows the user whether some of the custom microservices are missing CPU or Memory limits. It's still possible to save, however we strongly suggest to properly set resource limits.
