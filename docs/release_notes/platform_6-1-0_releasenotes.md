## v6.1.2

_October 26, 2020_

### New Features

#### Swagger aggregator

Allow a `prefix` field at the first level of the configuration. All the routes of all the services will be prefixed with this path.  

You can specify a custom prefix to be prepended to your APIs.
For example if your services expose `/food` endpoint you can configure the swagger aggregator to prefix all your routes with `/marketplace`¬†prefix and thus the API Portal will display `/marketplace/food`.  

See more in the [Swagger Aggregator documentation page](../development_suite/api-portal/swagger_conf).  

#### Supporting kubernetes access through proxy

Now each project can be configured to access its kubernetes cluster below a proxy, checkout the [configuration page](../development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/create-project.md#step-7-customize-your-cluster) for more information.

#### Pipeline update to v3

A new version of the deploy platform pipelines for GitLab installations is available. Major benefits of the new version are:

* Access to all future features

* No need for escaping of special characters

* Bugs encountered in the management of secrets with values in multiple lines have been resolved

Contact your Mia-Platform technical representative for information about the configuration.

#### New .NET Template

The new DotNet Microservice Template is now available.
See more on [GitHub](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/DotNet-Microservice-Template).

See how to do it on the [CMS documentation page](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/docs/business_suite/conf_cms#9-configure-the-gallery).

#### New pipeline

It is now available a new pipeline to build services using .NET Core.
Contact your Mia-Platform technical representative for more information.

### Bug Fix

#### CRUD Service

* In the automatic creation of the CRUD internal endpoint name, all underscores are now correctly transformed into dashes (in the previous version, in case of multiple underscores only the first occurence was replaced).

* The 32 characters limit to the properties name in the index section has been removed.

#### Requests traceability

The Crud service and Microservice Gateway now insert into logs the correct requestId that improves traceability of requests coming from CMS.

#### Auth0-Client login fix

The login flow with `grant_type` password now uses by default the scope `openid`, thus it aligns to other grant types.  

#### Deploy page

Fixed a bug that was preventing deployments of projects using Jenkins pipelines.

### Improvements

#### Authorization service v.2.0.1

The log level of the authorization service has been improved to reduce the amount of generated and collected logs.

### UI improvements

The UI of the microservice repository clone action has been revised.
