### Bug fix 

#### Navigation confirmation prompt appearing multiple times

Fixed a bug that happened in Design Area, after changing the configuration without saving and attempting to navigate elsewhere. This normally prompts the user with a confirmation dialog, which was previously popping up multiple times after clicking on cancel.

#### Status update after route deletion

Fixed a bug that prevented the branch icon of the Design section to signal a change with the orange color after the deletion of the route of an endpoint. 

### How to update your Console

For on-premise Console installations, please contact your Mia Platform referent to know how to use the `Helm chart version 4.4.3`.
