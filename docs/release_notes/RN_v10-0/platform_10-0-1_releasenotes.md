## Console

### Bug Fix

#### Endpoint section

Fixed problems that prevented a user to update "Show in API Portal", 
"Support only JSON format on request", "Force the endpoint to pass through the Microservice Gateway", 
"Support only JSON format on response", "Timeout", "Rate limit", "Request body size limit" values in Endpoint Settings

## How to update your Console

For on-premise Console installations, please contact your Mia Platform referent to know how to use the `Helm chart version 8.1.2`.
