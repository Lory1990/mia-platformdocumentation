Welcome to Mia-Platform v10.0, a major full of new integrations and functionalities for an Enriched Control Plane ensuring a Frictionless Developer Experience.

## Console

### Merge and Promote of configurations

Within the project, different users can concurrently work on the same branch configuration while having visibility of any changes remotely made by other users.  
More specifically, this new feature offers a better developer experience in Mia-Platform Console, allowing users to:

- have visibility on all the configuration changes made locally before committing them;
- start the merge process in order to align those changes to the last committed configuration within the same branch. 

Moreover, users can also align configurations of two different branches within the same project.  
In this way, it is possible to easily promote a branch configuration on different environments up to the production one.

### Management of Clusters in self-service mode

Through a brand new section in Mia-Platform Console, it is now possible to manage the infrastructure on which to deploy the Projects.  
In fact, it is possible to connect and manage Kubernetes Clusters through an easy-to-use interface and view some details about it, regardless of the Vendor and Kubernetes distribution installed.

### Management of Environment in self-service mode

The Environment section of the console has been enhanced, providing the ability for a user with respective permissions to be able to add, edit and delete an environment directly through a dedicated graphical interface on Mia-Platform Console.

### Providers & Tools Integration

Several new providers and tools have been integrated in Mia Platform console.

#### Git Providers: Azure DevOps and BitBucket

Mia-Platform Console supports the use of 2 new Git Providers, Azure DevOps and BitBucket, in order to meet almost all the technical needs of the market.

#### Jenkins

Mia-Platform Console is now integrated with Jenkins, another provider to better manage the Deploy pipelines.

#### Vault Secret Manager

Mia-Platform Console can now manage secreted variables through Vault secret manager.

### Project Quick Links

Inside of the project homepage, a Project Administrator can now set up and manage a carousel of quick useful links to better organize the team’s workload in a project. These links will be visible and clickable directly from the project homepage for all the members of the project.  
Moreover, they can also be reached through the shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + K, by clicking on the “Project Links” entry.  

## Fast Data

### Single View configuration Low Code in a dedicated area

Single View page now contains a dedicated tab where you can configure your Low Code aggregation without having to navigate to the Microservice page. Mia-Platform Console will help you to write your configuration thanks the integrated syntax checker.

### Single View Trigger

The Single View Trigger is a new microservice available on the Marketplace, whose purpose is to link the Real-Time Updater (RTU) and the Single View Creator.
The service will consume Kafka messages produced by the RTU on a specific topic, execute the appropriate strategies and generate projection changes either on MongoDB or Kafka.

### Salesforce Streaming API Connector

The Salesforce Connector Service provides a way to import data from StreamingAPI directly into your FastData projections.
This connector manages connection, authentication, and processing of data received via Salesforce streaming API. It listens to the changes of the data sources of Salesforce, and brings them on one or more Kafka topics.

## Marketplace

### Applications 2.0

In addition to Microservices, the applications in the Marketplace support the configuration of resources such as Endpoints, Public Variables and CRUD Collections.  
In this way, with a few simple clicks you can deploy perfectly functional applications without configuring anything!

### Backoffice

Mia-Platform Backoffice has new functionalities such as handling geographic data and bulk actions.  
Existing features have been enhanced with a particular focus on files - which can now be viewed in browser and modified in batches - and filters - with the “exist” operator and hidden static filters.

### Extended Payment Gateway Manager

Manage in one place all logics and business processes related to payments, now also supporting BNPL and recurrent payments.

### MongoDB Views for CRUD Service

The MongoDB View section has been introduced inside the Design area of the Console.  
Here, user can create and configure a View. Then, the view can be exposed through an Endpoint of type MongoDB View.  
Moreover, it is possible to see a MongoDB View's content from the CMS by creating a new CMS Page from the CMS section of the Console.
