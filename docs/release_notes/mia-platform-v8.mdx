Mia-Platform v8.0 allows you to easily develop your projects and leverage Kubernetes to power them. [Mia-Platform Console](../development_suite/overview-dev-suite) supports end-to-end development and takes care of whatever is needed to run your code. Thanks to the smooth integration with the best OSSs, the set-up and scaling of your projects will be fast and painless.

Mia-Platform v7.0 has been released on February 10 2021, and from that moment many powerful features have been developed to make your development experience with Mia-Platform Console smooth and simple. Keep on reading to know how.

### Multi-Git Providers

It has been changed the way to log into Mia-Platform Console by making it simpler and more practical.
Mia-Platform v8 supports Multi-Git Providers, embracing a more convenient login and accessing to the Mia-Platform Console with a single click.

### CRUD Encryption and GDPR Management

It has been introduced new features in order to manage sensible data and their protection inside Mia-Platform's Console.
With the new [Sensitivity](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/gdpr.md) functionality, you can now classify data in many different ways, organizing information into fixed categories with specific attributes. Data classification can help you stay compliant with the GDPR by allowing you to properly organize your data and implement security controls to detect anomalies.

With the new [Client-side encryption](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/gdpr.md) functionality, you can encode a specific portion of your data to become hidden or inaccessible to unauthorized users once stored on your database, being also able to decide the encryption methodology used.

### Dashboard management

The [Dashboard](../development_suite/monitoring/dashboard) section of Mia-Platform Console allows you to keep the tools you use to monitor your project close to its configuration. Here you can add new iFrames or edit or delete existing ones.

### Applications

From today, in addition to Examples, Templates and Plugins, there is a new type of microservice in the Marketplace, the “Application”.
[Applications](../marketplace/applications/mia_applications) are bundles of services including Plugins, Examples and Templates that can be instantiated and configured in a few clicks thanks to a guided path. Each installed application can be viewed in a dedicated tab of Mia-Platform Console, from which you can access its microservices with their repository.

### New User Experience

The user experience of navigation within the Console has been improved, gaining a greater workspace area:

- **The main menu** that allows to navigate among Areas is in a dedicated popover that can be opened through the apposite icon in the top left corner of the Topbar. You could also choose a bunch of shortcuts to navigate to favorite Areas that would be displayed in the Topbar. Read the [Console presentation](../development_suite/overview-dev-suite#sections-navigation) for more details.

- **The choice of the runtime environment** has been standardized and it is possible to select it from the dropdown menu in the right corner of the topbar in the sections Deploy, Dashboards, Runtime and Debug.

- **The branch management** of the Design area is now accessible in the right corner of the topbar. More information can be found in the Design [documentation](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/overview.md)

- **[Visualize](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/miacraft) and Advanced sections** of the Design area have been moved in the main sidebar, as sub-sections of "Mode" and "Workload" respectively.

### Mia-backoffice

The new [Mia-Platform Headless CMS](../business_suite/backoffice/overview.md) is much easier to maintain, test, and scale
with a new micro frontend architecture built on `micro-lc` that allows greater flexibility.

### Micro-lc

`micro-lc` is the Mia-Platform solution for building flexible, multi-tenant front-end applications following the
[Micro Frontend](https://micro-frontends.org/) architecture. It consists of a core interface that loads, embeds, and orchestrates **plugins** (your individual frontend applications) at runtime, while providing configuration options and useful out-of-the-box features.

The project is open source, and it can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mia-platform/micro-lc). Although the
core components are written in Typescript and React, micro-lc is **technology-agnostic**, which means that it integrates
seamlessly with your favorite toolkit, being it Angular, React, Vue, or anything else you like: even vanilla JavaScript!

### Flow Manager Visualizer

The [Flow Manager Visualizer](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/flow-manager-visualizer) aims at simplifying your Saga Pattern management and orchestrate your business logic in a distributed flow. By selecting the Flow Manager menu in the Design Area you will be presented with the list of flow-manager services that are currently configured in your project. The visualizer allows you to follow the flow of states, to view which commands are activated, to see the triggered events and any remediation process.

### Runtime Monitoring

The runtime area is increasingly functional: the PODs table has been enriched for a correct and complete visualization of the status of the individual POD and the reading of the logs has been enhanced and simplified, allowing a better visualization of the consumption of resources.

### Fast Data Single Views

The Design area helps you to speed up the Mia-Platform Fast Data configuration. Additionally to the management of Projections and Cast Function, available in Mia-Platform v7.0, you can now configure your Single Views, using the [dedicated section](../fast_data/single_view). Define the fields of the single view and which Single View Creators services will update the single view in the `Data Model` section, and set the strategies for each projection directly in the [Strategies](../fast_data/single_view#strategies) section of the single view you need to update.

### Smart deploy

The [Smart Deploy](../development_suite/deploy/deploy#smart-deploy) is a deployment functionality accessible from the Deploy page. By toggling the dedicated switch, users can now selectively release only the services whose configuration has been updated since the last deployment. In this way, you can save time and resources with faster and safer releases.

### Public Variables

The design section offers you **Public Variables**, a page where you can easily create branch level configurations with different values for each environment. You can have further details regarding this section on the public variables [documentation](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/public_variables.md) page. On Premise installations require specific changes to the deploy pipelines, please contact your technical referent to be supported for activation.

### Mia-Craft

[Mia-Craft](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/miacraft) is a simple but essential tool: it helps you to get a graphic overview of the architecture of your project by opening the Visualize tab in the Design Section of Mia-Platform Console. Starting from the project configurations, Mia-Craft creates an initial view, to which you can link your services and the calls, providing a complete, transparent and shareable picture of your application.
