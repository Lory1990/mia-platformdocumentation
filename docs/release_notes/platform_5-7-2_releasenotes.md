* **Branch**     
    Now it is possible to create **branches with forward slash `/` in the name**.

* **Console Menu**        
    If you do not have Documentation in the selected Branch, **Documentation's SubMenu is not shown**.



## Fixed

* **Branch**      
    When you **commit on an existent branch** on DevOps Console, you are not redirected to the modal of branch selection, but you remain in the 'Commit & Generate' Area.

* **Console Homepage**     
    Restyling of the **homepage cards' boxshadow**: when you select a DevOps Console area, the shadow below the card is no more cut.
