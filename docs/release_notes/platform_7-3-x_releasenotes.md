## v7.3.0

_March 31, 2021_

### New Features

#### Visualize your projects

[Mia-Craft](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/miacraft.md) is a visualization tool that allows the user to see graphically the microservices in the project and to recreate the conceptual flow adopted during the design of the projectâ€™s configuration.
You can now access it by opening the Visualize tab in the Design Section of Mia-Platform Console. Read the documentation for additional information.

#### Updated libraries for NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS

Libraries that handle CA certificates have been updated and it is now possible to use self-signed certificates to send requests to an external backend server.

#### dockerImageNameSuggestion customization from tenant

The property `dockerImageNameSuggestion` has been added to [tenants](../development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/create-project#create-a-tenant). The property is inherited by new projects in the tenant and allows you to customize the suggestion for the "Docker Image Name" field during the [creation of a microservice](../development_suite/api-console/api-design/services#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-an-example-or-from-a-template).

### Breaking Changes

#### Projection changes and System of Record association

The [projection changes](../fast_data/create_projection#projections-changes) collection is not global for all [Systems of Record](../fast_data/create_projection#create-a-system-of-record) anymore. Now, for each System of Record, there is a specific projection changes collection.

If you are not using a custom `projection-changes-collection` and you have important information in the collection `fast-data-projection-changes` (e.g. kafka messages have been sent by CDC but they have not been consumed yet), you need to move them in the new `projection-changes` collections. Please read the [projection changes documentation](../fast_data/create_projection#projections-changes) to know how to find them.

As an alternative, you can keep using the collection `fast-data-projection-changes` by configuring it as a custom `projection-changes-collection` from the [advanced](../fast_data/advanced#projections-changes) section.

### Bug Fix

#### Compare table visibility

In the [Deploy area](../development_suite/deploy/deploy#deploy-area), the Compare table was not visible in new projects before the first deployment in a specific environment. Now the table correctly displays the microservices that will be deployed at the first release.

#### Excessive annotation's name length

Fixed a bug causing the impossibility to Deploy in projects using `Mia-Platform pipelines v3` with microservices with particularly long names.

### How to update your Console

For on-premise Console installations, please contact your Mia Platform referent to know how to use the `Helm chart version 3.6.0`.
