### Fixes

* **Design - Endpoint**    (questa l'abbiamo già "data per scontata" nello scorso... non la metterei)
    The configurations created from **endpoint with dot inside the name** have been fixed.

* **Design - CMS**        
    When you create a CMS page and you attach an endpoint with dot inside the name, the `GoToProperties` section **does not crash anymore**.

* **Design**       
    The three grey dots of the menù resize icon are **no more visible over the menu item expansion**.
