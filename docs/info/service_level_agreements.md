The Mia-Platform Service Level Agreement (**“SLA”**) describes the service availability commitment for the Mia-Platform PaaS Hosting Service under the Terms of Service or Subscription Agreement between Mia-Platform (“Provider”) and its Customer.

During the period of your Mia-Platform PaaS Hosting Services, Mia-Platform will use any commercially reasonable efforts to make the Mia-Platform PaaS Hosting Services available with a Monthly Service Availability (Uptime) as detailed below in the section *Service Levels*.

## Definitions

* **Service** refers to the PaaS hosting service regulated by the relative Agreement between Customer and Supplier, which includes the provision of the Infrastructure and its monitoring, maintenance and assistance;

* **Monthly Service Time** is the monthly time in which the Service is required to be available. It is calculated monthly as defined in the Subscription Form or in the absence of a definition by multiplying the days of the month by the 24 hours of the day;

* **Monthly Service Unavailability (Downtime)**: the Service is unavailable when all users are unable to access (using more than one network connection) the Product and/or a functionality of the Product and/or Add-on Components, due to infrastructural problems. Excluded from these problems are those of an application nature, including but not limited to: bugs in the code of the Product or Add-on Components;

* **Monthly Service Availability (Uptime)** is the availability of the Service. It is calculated monthly by subtracting from the Service Time the sum of all the minutes of unavailability of the Service in the month. The calculation of the Service Availability Time starts from the moment of opening a Severity 1 ticket and ends at its resolution. It is possible to open a ticket by email to the address defined in the Subscription Form containing more information on the procedures and timing of the request.

## Service Levels

The service levels define the percentage of the **Monthly Service Time** that will be guaranteed as available monthly (Monthly Service Availability (Uptime)).

Mia S.r.l. undertakes to the Customer to offer the services of infrastructural monitoring and infrastructural assistance, according to the agreed service time and according to the type of service level (**SLA**) indicated by the Customer in the Subscription Form between the two options below:

* **Basic**: which defines that for 99% of the Monthly Service Time, the Service itself will be guaranteed as available;

* **Premium**: which defines that for 99.5% of the Monthly Service Time, the Service itself will be guaranteed as available;

## Incident Report

As part of the Infrastructure Assistance Service, the Client has the right to open an Incident Ticket if he finds a problem of Availability or degradation of the service. Timetables, methods and tools for opening the tickets are specified in the Subscription Form.

Mia-Platform undertakes to promptly manage the incident reported by the Client. Incidents are distinguished according to the degree of severity attributed below:

* **Severity 1**: the Service is not available. The period of unavailability of the Service is counted from the opening of the ticket by the Client only if the incident to which it is referred is confirmed as being of an infrastructural nature and not application nature;

* **Severity 2**: the Service is degraded (for example: the service is slowed down).
