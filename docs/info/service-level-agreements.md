# Mia Service Level Agreement       

The Mia Service Level Agreement (**“SLA”**) describes the service availability commitment for the Mia Cloud Hosting Service under the Terms of Service or Subscription Agreement between Mia S.r.l. (“Provider”) and its Customer.

During the period of your Mia Cloud Hosting Services, Mia S.r.l. will use any commercially reasonable efforts to make the Mia Cloud Hosting Services available with a Monthly Service Availability (Uptime) as detailed below in the section *Service Levels*. If Mia does not meet the Service Level, Customers will be eligible to receive a Service Credit after opening an Incident Ticket.

## Definitions        

* **Service** refers to the cloud hosting service regulated by the relative Agreement between Customer and Supplier, which includes the provision of the Infrastructure and its monitoring, maintenance and assistance;

* **Monthly Service Time** is the monthly time in which the Service is required to be available. It is calculated monthly as defined in the Subscription Form or in the absence of a definition by multiplying the days of the month by the 24 hours of the day;

* **Monthly Service Unavailability (Downtime)**: the Service is unavailable when all users are unable to access (using more than one network connection) the Product and/or a functionality of the Product and/or Add-on Components, due to infrastructural problems. Excluded from these problems are those of an application nature, including but not limited to: bugs in the code of the Product or Add-on Components;

* **Monthly Service Availability (Uptime)** is the availability of the Service. It is calculated monthly by subtracting from the Service Time the sum of all the minutes of unavailability of the Service in the month. The calculation of the Service Availability Time starts from the moment of opening a Severity 1 ticket and ends at its resolution.

## Service Levels        

The service levels define the percentage of the **Monthly Service Time** that will be guaranteed as available monthly (Monthly Service Availability (Uptime)).

The two possible service levels are:

* **Basic**: which defines that for 99% of the Monthly Service Time, the Service itself will be guaranteed as available; 

* **Advanced**: which defines that for 99.5% of the Monthly Service Time, the Service itself will be guaranteed as available;

Mia S.r.l. undertakes, towards the Customer, to offer, with due diligence, the services of infrastructural monitoring and infrastructural assistance, according to the agreed service time and according to the type of service level (**SLA**) indicated by the Customer in the Subscription Form between the two options below:

Service Level | Service Time Guaranteed 
-------| -------|
Basic| >= 99%
Advanced| >= 99,5%

## Service Credits

As part of the Infrastructure Assistance Service, the Client has the right to open an Incident Ticket if he finds a problem of Availability or degradation of the service. Timetables, methods and tools for opening the tickets are specified in the Subscription Form.

Mia S.r.l. undertakes to promptly manage the incident reported by the Client. Incidents are distinguished according to the degree of severity attributed below:

* **Severity 1**: the Service is not available. The period of unavailability of the Service is counted from the opening of the ticket by the Client only if the incident to which it is referred is confirmed as being of an infrastructural nature;

* **Severity 2**: the Service is degraded (for example: the service is slowed down).

## SLA Exclusions

The SLA does not apply to any unavailability of the Mia Cloud Hosting Services:

1. That results from (i) a suspension described in Section 6.6 of the Agreement (Late Payments) or (ii) Customer’s misuse of the Confluent Cloud Service in violation of Section 3 of the Agreement (Acceptable Use);
