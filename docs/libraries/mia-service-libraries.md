# Mia service libraries
For the purpose of facilitating the creation of [Custom Microservices](./../development_suite/api-console/api-design/plugin_baas_4.md) and interact with the Platform in various languages and frameworks, you can use specific libraries.

We'll call these libraries **Mia service libraries**. You can find ready-to-use libraries on [Mia-Platform Github repository](https://github.com/mia-platform).

Actually the libraries available are:


| **Library** | **Technologies** |
| ------|------------|
|[Mia service Node.js library](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib)|Node.js, JavaScript|
|[Mia service Java library](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-java)| Kotlin/Java|
|[Mia service Spring Boot library](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-java-springboot)|Spring Boot, Kotlin/Java  |
|[Mia service NET library](https://github.com/mia-platform/Mia-service-Net-Library)|.NET, C#|


More libraries are in developing, but if you need to create a Custom Microservices in a specific language or framework and feel the need for a library, you can [build it from yourself](./create-new-library.md).
