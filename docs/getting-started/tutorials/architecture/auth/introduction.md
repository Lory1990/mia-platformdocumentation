Welcome to the Mia-Platform Auth Architecture tutorial! This is an holistic guide on the crucial realm of both authentication and authorization, exploring all the possible architectures you could implement with Mia-Platform.

We'll start with the basics, addressing the simplest scenarios first, and gradually advance, tackling multi-project architectures and integrating multiple external Identity Providers. 

For each of the following scenarios, we will provide an overview of the architecture and a complete step-by-step tutorial to implement it.

### Scenarios

These are the scenarios you can find in this tutorial:
- [Scenario 1: Use a static API Key to secure your endpoints](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/static-api-key.md)
- [Scenario 2: Integrate an external Identity Provider to your project](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/external-idp.md)
- [Scenario 3: Use an external Identity Provider for the login phase but manage session and user groups within your project](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/external-idp-internal-session.md)
- [Scenario 4: Multiple projects](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/multiple-projects.md)
- [Scenario 5: Enterprise Architecture with edge gateways](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/enterprise-architecture.md)
