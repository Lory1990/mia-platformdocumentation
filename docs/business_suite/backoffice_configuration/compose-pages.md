:::caution
This is a **BETA** feature and, as such, is currently under **active development**. Pay attention using this section.
:::

The pages of type [_compose_](/business_suite/backoffice_configuration/structure.md#page-type) can be configured in a **dedicated section**
accessible via _edit page_ option in pages [context menu](/business_suite/backoffice_configuration/structure.md#edit-page).

For the time being, configurations can be edited only with an advanced visualization where the page is divided into a
**code editor** and a **live preview**.

This configurator works just the same as the one in the structure section, so refer to its 
[documentation](/business_suite/backoffice_configuration/structure.md#advanced-configuration) for an in-depth explanation of the
available features.

:::tip
You can refer the [micro-lc documentation](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/compose) on how to propertly
configure a compose page.

Moreover, the editor will help you in the process hinting the correct JSON schema.
