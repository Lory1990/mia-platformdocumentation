## From Mia marketplace

Mia Platform marketplace has a template Backoffice application that can be spawned on any project which already
contains a API Gateway and a Microservice Gateway.

At configuration time, 4 services will be spawned:

- microlc frontend
- microlc element composer frontend
- microlc backend
- back-kit webcomponent library web server

:::caution

Be aware of the fact that the following services:

- [API Gateway](../../runtime_suite/envoy-api-gateway/overview)
- [Microservice Gateway](../../runtime_suite/microservice-gateway/overview)

are not provided by the application. You can simply add them, without extra config,
from [Mia Marketplace](../../marketplace/overview_marketplace).

:::

If absent, a CRUD service, with a single preset collection, will be added to the k8s deploy.

That's enough to get started with the application configuration

## Configuration

To get started on Backoffice configuration on your local machine consider following the [tutorial](https://github.com/micro-lc/backoffice-local).
This will allow you to spawn a docker-compose equivalent environment on your machine and test configuration edits by simply refreshing your
browser.

A Back-Kit application that uses a rendering engine such as the one of [microlc-v1](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc), is structured into multiple configuration files.

- an `authentication.json` file
- a `configuration.json` file
- a configuration file for each plugin. These can be organized in subfolders

This is an example of a typical structure for a Back-Kit application:

- authentication.json
- configuration.json
- getting-started.json
- my-cms-collection.json

### Authentication

`authentication.json` contains information on the authentication requirements.
For example:

```json
{
  "isAuthNecessary": false
}
```

when the frontend doesn't need to inject/redirect for an authenticated principal, or
similarly

```json
{
  "isAuthNecessary": true,
  "userInfoUrl": "/userinfo",
  "userLogoutUrl": "/logout?redirect=/web-login?redirect=/"
}
```

which declares that the user must log in to access the application,
and also should provide endpoints for fetching user information as well as for handling logout routes.

### Plugin Configuration

`configuration.json` contains high-level information on the structure of the application.

        },

            "configurationName": "ingredients-list"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`configuration.json` first includes information about theming:

```json
"theming": {
    "header": {
      "pageTitle": "Back-Kit Application",
      "favicon": "https://url/to/the/icon.png"
    },
    "logo": {
      "alt": "Logo",
      "url_light_image": "https://urs/to/the/image.png"
    },
    "variables": {
      "primaryColor": "#087436"
    },
    "menuLocation": "fixedSideBar"
  }
```

It is possible to specify theme-related information, such as

- a logo, which is visible in the application
- a page title and icon, which appears in the brawser tab
- a primary color, which influences the look of plugins
- positioning of the plugins menu. This is a menu that allows the user to switch plugins

The `shared` section of the file

```json
"shared": {
    "props": {
      "headers": {
        "client-key": ...
      }
    }
  }
```

includes information such as HTTP headers, which may propagate cookies or other settings to manage HTTP calls.

Thirdly, the `rightMenu` section allows to specify the content of a right menu. In the example, a [notification center](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc-notification-center) component is specified.

Finally, `plugins`

```json
"plugins": [
  {
    "id": "ordersList",
    "label": "Orders",
    "icon": "fas fa-paper-plane",
    "integrationMode": "qiankun",
    "pluginRoute": "/bo-orders-list",
    "pluginUrl": "/element-composer/",
    "props": {
      "configurationName": "orders-list"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "usersCategory",
    "label": "Users",
    "icon": "fas fa-users",
    "content": [
      ...
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "menuCategory",
    "label": "Menu",
    "icon": "fas fa-book-open",
    "content": [
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

includes information on the structure of the plugin menu.

- `id` is a unique identifier of the menu option
- `label` and `icon` describe the look of the option in the menu
- `integrationMode` indicates the strategy to use for loading the plugin
- `pluginRoute` is the url of the plugin
- `pluginUrl` is the url of the rendering engine
- `props` includes further information; in particular `configurationName`, which indicates what configuration file to use for resolving the plugin once the option is selected
- plugin menu can also be structure its options into subgroups using a `content` option, which includes an array of plugins

The following image shows the plugin menu resulting from the example:

![Example of plugin menu](img/plugins_menu.png)

### Plugins

Each plugin has its own configuration file, as described in [layout](page_layout).

Following is an image of a Back-Kit application with an empty plugin:

![Example of plugin with an empty plugin](img/no_plugin_spa.png)

The page only includes information specified in the `configuration.json` file, and on the logged-in user.

Once a complete configuration for the plugin is provided, the resulting plugin will be displayed. Selecting a new plugin in the right menu will cause the new plugin to be rendered, without the need for the whole page to load again.

For a full example of a plugin configuration, refer to [plugin](plugin_example).
