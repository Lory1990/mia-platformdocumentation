## Console Sections

Mia-Platform Console is divided in many different sections that help you manage the full lifecycle of your digital projects, from the set up of your K8s clusters to APIs and microservices design. Run your CI/CD pipelines, deploy on every kind of environment and monitor the performances of your runtime applications.

### Environments

Get started with your project in a few clicks: configure Kubernetes clusters, set up your [runtime environments](./set-up-infrastructure/runtime-environments) and manage all their [environment variables](./set-up-infrastructure/env-var).

### Design

Develop containerized services in any language with [Templates](../marketplace/templates/mia_templates), [Examples](../marketplace/examples/mia_examples) or [Plugins](../runtime_suite/mia-platform-plugins). Configure your [CRUDs](./api-console/api-design/crud_advanced), [Endpoints](./api-console/api-design/endpoints), [Fast Data flow](../fast_data/overview) and much more.

### Deploy

Design and build your [CI/CD pipelines](../development_suite/deploy/deploy.md): choose your preferred DevOps tools, put them in the right order and let the Console do the work for you.
[Release](./deploy/deploy#select-branch) across different environments with rolling, blue/green, and canary releases. Make rollback easy with your GIT files history.

### Dashboards

Create your dashboards collecting data across the entire DevOps lifecycle to gain a complete overview of your application delivery value stream.

### Runtime

[Monitor](../development_suite/monitoring/monitoring/) your pods, health of clusters, storage consumption and communication among services to anticipate problems and bottlenecks.

### Debug

Automate your tests suite to deliver quality software at a sustainable pace. [Debug](./debugging/telepresence) your kubernetes pods locally with your preferred debugging tool.

### Sections Navigation

All the aforementioned sections can be reached using Mia-Platform Console homepage or by using the pop-up menu in the left side of the topbar.
