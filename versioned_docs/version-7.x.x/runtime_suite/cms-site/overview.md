## CMS Site

The CMS Site service provides a way of interacting with the CRUD service content from a user-friendly web page, which allows you to perform the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

It is possible to organize the content in *categories*, which improves navigation of the CMS Site. In order to configure the CMS from the console, you can follow [this documentation](../../business_suite/cms_configuration/config_cms).

### Custom Frontends

With the CMS Site it is possible to include custom frontends to display some desired content all in one place. A popular choice of custom frontends is [data visualization](../../business_suite/data-visualization).

## Configuration

CMS Site does not require any configuration file or any environment variables.
