### Authorization Service and Auth0Client Service

Mia Platform boost their security and authentication system with 2new microservices.

* Read [here](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/development_suite/api-console/api-design/how_to_enable_auth0/) how to enable this new authentication and authorization mode.
* [Auth0Client](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/runtime_suite/auth0-client/how_to_use/) : This service handles authentication and user management using auth0 as an identity provider.  
* [Authorization Service](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/runtime_suite/authorization-service/how_to_use/): This service exposes an /auth endpoint that, once that you have provided a configuration, handles the access to a specific combination of route and method.  

### DevOps Console
