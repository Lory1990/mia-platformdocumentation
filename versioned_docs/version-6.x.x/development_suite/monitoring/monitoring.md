## Monitoring Infrastructure

The Monitoring Infrastructure section is the Developer Console area dedicated to the control and monitoring of its infrastructure.

The area is divided by the number of environments existing in that specific project. And it is possible to change the environment to be monitored via a tab in the top menu.

Within each individual environment you can view all the available pods with specific logs. In addition to viewing the logs, you can top up your PODs by clicking "Refresh POD".

The user can also choose to **restart** their own POD by deleting it. Clicking "Delete POD" on the user the POD will be deleted and restarted. To view the new logs, the user will have to wait for the page to reload or to reload the page.
